Assignment 7: The Great Firewall of Santa Cruz

Description: This assignment consists of two sets of words: badspeak and newspeak. Badspeak are
words that cannot be said at all, while newspeak words are words that now have newspeak variants
that should be said instead. This program catches these words that the user inputs and prints out
a corresponding message correcting their behavior.

Instructions: To build the program, type 'make', 'make all', or 'make banhammer'. Type 'make clean' to
remove all compiler generated files, and type 'make format' to format all of the .c and .h files. To
run the program type './banhammer'. The program has the following command line options: '-h' prints out
the help message, '-t' specifies the size of the hash table entries, '-f' specifies the size of the bloom
filter entries, '-m' will enable move to front (disabled by default), and '-s' will print statistics to
stdout.

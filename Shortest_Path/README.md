Assignment 4: The Circumnavigations of Denver Long

Description: This program takes in a number of vertices, the names of cities, and the vertices themselves,
in order to find the shortest Hamiltonian path that connects all of the vertices back to the origin.

Instructions: To build the program run the Makefile by typing 'make' or 'make all' into the command line.
To run the program type './tsp'. By typing one of the following on the same command line you can access a
variety of options. Type '-h' to read the help documentation describing what each command line option does.
Type '-v' to enable verbose printing, which means that all Hamiltonian paths will be printed along with the
number of recursive calls that they had to make. Type '-u' to specify the graph as undirected. Type '-i' to
specify an input file that the program should read from for input. Type '-o' to specify an output file that
the program should write to. Note that by default, the program will read input from standard input and print
using standard output.

Assignment 6: Huffman Coding

Description: This assignment consists of multiple data structures that are used to compress and
decompress messages by encoding and decoding them using the Huffman Coding Algorithm.

Instructions: To build the encoder, type 'make encode'. To build the decoder type 'make decode'.
To build all of the programs, type 'make' or 'make all'. Type 'make clean' to remove all compiler
generated files, and type 'make format' to format all of the .c and .h files. To run the encoder,
type './encode'. To run the decoder, type './decode'. Both the encoder and the decoder have the
following command line options: '-i' to specify the input file for the program to read from (defaults
to stdin). '-o' to specify an output file for the program to write to (defaults to stdout), '-h' to
display the help message, and '-v' to print out statistics about the file compression or decompression.

Assignment 3: Sorting - Putting Your Affairs in Order

Description: This program implements bubble sort, shell sort, and quick sort with quick sort being
implemented both by using a stack and by using a queue. It prints a series of elements that have been
sorted as well as the size, number of moves, and comparisons that the sorting algorithm had to make.

Instructions: To build the program run the Makefile by typing 'make' or 'make all' into the command line.
To run the program type './sorting' and then type at least one of the following on that same command line:
'-a', '-b', '-s', '-q', '-Q', to indicate which sort you want to run. Type '-a' to run all of the sorts.
Type '-b' to run bubble sort. Type '-s' to run shell sort. Type '-q' to run quick sort with a stack, and
type '-Q' to run quick sort with a queue. You can also type '-r' followed by a number to set the random seed
for the random values of the array that is sorted. You can also set the size by typing '-n', and you can set
the number of elements printed by typing '-p'.

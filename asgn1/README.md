Assigment 1: Left, Right, and Center

Description: This program runs the game Left, Right, and Center by asking for the user
to enter an integer value for the seed and for the number of players playing the game.
The program will print a series of statements documenting each turn of the game, ending
with a statement stating who the winner is, how much money is in the center pot, and how
much money they won with.

Instructions: To build the program, run the Makefile by typing 'make' into the command line 
(not including quotations). To run the program, type './lrc'. The user will be asked to input 
any number for the seed. Then the user will be asked to enter a number of players between
1 < n <= 14. If either of these inputs are invalid, an invalid statement will be printed,
and the user will have to run the program again.
